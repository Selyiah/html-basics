HTML = structure of the web page 
CSS = the beauty, the design of the web page (style and formatting) 
Javascript = The function and user interaction 

CSS * reminder * Cascading style sheets = meaning that order of code matters (cascading order is a set of rules that determine which style will be applied to an element when multiple styles are conflicting).

So ideally the order should be: 

position > float > display 

(although there are exceptions to overriding, like specific classes and IDs).
